## Rules
1. Turns:

Players take turns in the order of their team colors (e.g., red, blue, green, yellow).

2. Claiming Panels:

On a player's turn, they can claim any unclaimed panel by clicking on it.
The claimed panel will change to the player's team color.

3. Flipping Panels:

If a player claims a panel that is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to an opponent's panels, the adjacent panels are checked to see if they are surrounded by the claiming player's color.
Any surrounded panels are flipped to the claiming player's color.

4. Adjacency Rule:

A panel can only be claimed if it is adjacent to a panel that has already been claimed (except the first panel).

5. ***Winner:***

The team with the most panels of their color when all panels are claimed.
